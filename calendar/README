Skins / Themes
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin is skinable.

This plugin ships a default skin which fits to the default skin of
RoundCube.

The plugin tries to load a plugin skin which is named after the skin
which is set for the whole RoundCube installation. The plugin's
default skin is used as the fallback if no customized skin of that
name exists.

To create your own skin, create a new directory (e.g., "myskin") in the 
this plugin's skins/ directory. Then copy the files you want to adopt
from the default skin to the folder of your new skin. Files which are
not found in the customized skin will be taken from the default skin.

Backends
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The plugin separates the calendar view from the underlying backend.

The following backends are available:

0. "dummy": A demonstrator for basic calendar functionality.

In contrast to other backends, "dummy" does not depend on any
databases or servers.

1. "database": The default backend

Local SQL database. There is a SQL file to initially set up the
databases and tables.

2. "google": (Status: coming soon)

Requires a Google account!

3. "caldav": (Status: alpha)

Note: This backend has only been tested with a DAViCal 0.9.7 server!

Features:
- Event viewing (getEvents)

Known issues:
- A fixed user and clear text password has to be stored in config.inc.php
- Cannot add/remove/move/resize events
- Only one calendar per user can be configured in config.inc.php
  (for now it seems to show all calendars of a user in one calendar, however)
- Possible problems with multiple lines in descriptions
- ... (guess there are more issues :-)
